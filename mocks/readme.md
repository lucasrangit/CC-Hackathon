# Hackathon mocks

## Mocks from the dashboard

Mocks exported from real dashboards are available here as json and csv. The data is taken for every minute. Many sensors do not have data for every minute. `null` means that there was no data in the interval of the last minute.

## Artificial mocks

As mentioned, they are available at [gdrive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1WtMuegGTIehZ2rUXG0ONByHEFRUTJ6OG?usp=sharing) and can be exported by Fabian and Benjamin to jsons.

Also the sheets can be copied and the functions can be changed. Come to us with any suggestion.
